    "\n",
    "Last week you learned that each transaction leads to an increase of the receiver's social capital weight.<p>\n",
    "This week you will try to identify fraudulent behavior within the system. For this you will leverage some of the techniques that you learned in the previous exercise sheets. <p>\n",
    "The fraud detection will work along the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "1) Identify the highest SCWs in the market depending on the topics<p>\n",
    "2) Identify the most frequent transaction pairs (user ids) in the market<p>\n",
    "3) Look at the friends/follower relationships on the social networking platform of the people with the highest SCW<p>\n",
    "4) Compare the activity of the identified people on the social networking platform<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps you can identify users who have a high social capital weight, but no support/contributions on the social networking platform. Therefore it is likely that they tried to cheat the system.\n",
